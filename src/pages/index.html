    <p>The FATREC Workshop on Responsible Recommendation at 
      <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/recsys17/">RecSys 2017</a> is a venue for discussing questions of social responsibility in building, maintaining, evaluating, and studying recommender systems. This will be an interactive workshop with position papers, research papers, and discussion about how ethical, social, and legal concerns impact recommender systems research and development, hoping to result in an agenda for research on socially responsible recommendation.
    <p>See the <a href="cfp.html">Call for Papers</a> for more details on how to participate.
    The <a href="http://www.fatml.org/resources/relevant-scholarship">FATML Resources</a> page has a useful list of papers on how some of the issues we hope to discuss have been handled in the broader machine learning community.
