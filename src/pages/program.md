The following is our tentative program, subject to change.

Complete proceedings are in [ScholarWorks](http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cs_facpubs/98/).

## Format

Each paper session will follow a similar format, with some differences in timing:

- Each paper will present, followed by brief clarifying questions about it while the next presenter sets up.
